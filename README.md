## Dataset
- **CIFAR-10**  
· CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of ```60,000``` color images, each with a size of ```32x32``` pixels.  
· These images are divided into ```10``` distinct classes, and each class contains ```6,000``` images.  
· The dataset is balanced, meaning that there are an equal number of images for each class.  
· The dataset is split into two subsets: a training set and a test set.  
· The training set contains ```50,000``` images (5,000 images per class), while the test set consists of ```10,000``` images (1,000 images per class).

## Setting
- **Model**  
· patch size: 4x4  
· embedding size: 192  
· num layers: 12  
· num classes: 10  
· num heads: 12
- **Training**   
· batch size: 256  
· num epoch: 50  
· optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001, weight_decay=5e-5)

· To extract the best performance among 50 epochs, ```early stopping``` was employed.  
· In this experiment, the validation set and the test set are the same.  
· The best model can be confirmed through ```weight/cifar_vit_pe_conv.pth```.

## How to Visualize the Image?
- The attention map's row vector corresponding to the ```cls token``` was utilized.  
- The trained cls token serves as the ```representation of the image```, indicating where the model is focusing on in the image through the cls token portion of the attention map.
- For dramatic visualization, the following steps were employed:
```
1. Create a single row vector by averaging 'num_head' row vectors. (using average attention weights)  
2. Convert the row vector (1x64) into a 2D matrix (8x8).  
3. Resize the matrix to the original image size (32x32).  
4. Perform min-max normalization on the matrix. (scaling values to range between 0 and 1) 
5. Multiply the matrix with the original image. (incorporating the focused area into the original image)  
6. Multiply the resulting matrix by 2 and visualize it. (amplifying the representation of the focused area)
```
